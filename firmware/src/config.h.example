//   python3 server/device_login.py
// (do NOT use `claude setup-token` - those tokens lack the user:profile scope
// the usage endpoint requires, so they 403.) It's a separate login from your
// everyday Claude Code session, so the device refreshing it never logs you out
// elsewhere. The device turns it into short-lived access tokens on its own and
// remembers the rotated token in flash (NVS), so you only paste it once.
// Treat it like a password.

//   curl -X POST http://claude-display.local:8080/mode/spotify
//   curl -X POST http://claude-display.local:8080/mode/usage      (or /mode/toggle)

// (it walks you through creating the free Spotify app first). Leave both empty
// to disable Spotify mode. Treat the token like a password.

//   http://<MDNS_NAME>.local:<BEACON_PORT>/

// Safety backstop only: if no beacon arrives for this long, fall back to idle.
// The precise "stopped" signal is an explicit POST /thinking/off (e.g. from a
// Claude Code Stop hook - see README), so this just catches a sender that died
// mid-turn. Keep it well above the longest gap between "on" pings.
#define BEACON_TTL_MS 300000   // 5 minutes
